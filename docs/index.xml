      <description>This lesson has more math than usual, but it&amp;rsquo;s important that we don&amp;rsquo;t shy away the theory behind deep learning. It will help us build a strong understanding of the algorithms we will code in later sections. If you feel overwhelmed by the math here, please see this review first.
We are talking of neural networks, then what is a neuron? Certainly not the kind that is in your brain. While biologically inspired, artificial neurons are very different from the real counterpart, thus for now put aside any comparison with brains.</description>

      <description>Welcome to this course on Deep Learning for Computer Vision!
This course will teach you the fundamentals of Deep Learning applied to images. Each topic will be covered under three different type of materials:
 Lessons, such as this one, accompanied with slides and small quizzes between chapters; Practices, with Google Colab notebooks where we will code actual algorithms; And, quizzes, where you will test your recall on the important notions.</description>
