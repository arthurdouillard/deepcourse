This is a course I'm giving to the French engineering school EPITA each Fall. This course is the new version (as of 2021) of my lectures serie.
It's given in around 24h, with sessions of 4 hours each made of 2 hours of lessons and 2 hours of coding.

If you find a mistake (in the lesson, notebook, or quiz), please open an issue here. Likewise, if you have ideas to improve this course (should I cover topic X? etc.), please also open an issue.
